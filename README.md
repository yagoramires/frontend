# Brief
The organizers of a new React conference are looking for a
website that breaks down all of the information for their event.
This is important, because it helps to get people interested in
the event, but also figure out how to actually enjoy the event.
Before anything else, people need to know about the event.
Where is it? What day is it? Where can people sleep?

# Level 1
Create a multi-page website that includes all of the basic
information about the new conference. The basic information
should include details like the name of the event, a
description, the date, the location, food options, hotel options,
and importantly a code of conduct.
People can now find out about the event, but who is going to
speak at the event and what are they going to talk about?

# Level 2
Add a list of speakers to the homepage and create a schedule
that lists each speaker with a talk and time.
Managing a little content isn’t too bad in the code, but what if
the conference organizers want to make a text change? They
shouldn’t have to or might not be able to check out the code
and make the change.

# Level 3
Set up a content management system (CMS) and source the
content of the website with that system.
